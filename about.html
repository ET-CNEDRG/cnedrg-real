  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>The Central New England Dental Research Group (CNERDG) was founded in 1966 by Maurice H. Martel, inspired by the St. Louis Dental Research Group, to bring together dentists committed to professional growth and excellence in patient care. For nearly six decades , the group has emphasized practice administration, clinical innovation, and collegial fellowship. Over the years, members have benefitted from access to leading clinicians and cutting-edge continuing education, often in intimate settings that encouraged personal exchange and lasting friendships. With a tradition of independence, dedication, and shared learning, the CNERDG has thrived as a community of “above-the-line” dentists devoted to advancing dentistry while supporting one another both professionally and personally.</p>
