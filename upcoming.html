      <h1>Upcoming Speakers</h1>
      
        <p>We are excited to announce the dates for next year's lectures, so please mark your calendars.  We are in the process of finalizing some details regarding the exact topics and the venue, so stay tuned for updates, but it was really important to us that we get you these dates as soon as possible so you can plan accordingly. 
        </p>

      <h1>October 17, 2025: Dr. Wael Garine</h1>

      <h4>Treating the Edentulous patient (implant focused)</h4>

        <p>Dr. Garine is a renowned prosthodontist and educator with a focus on implant and digital dentistry.  He brings incredibly modernized techniques to these complex cases.  Those of you who have been fortunate enough to hear him before know what a treat this is.
        </p>

      <h1>March 20th, 2026: Dr. Pushkar Mehra</h1>
    
    <h4>
      Modern Oral and Orthognathic Surgery (not how to do it, but what it can accomplish for our patients and when it is indicated)
    </h4>

      <p>Dr. Mehra is the Chief of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at BMC. If any of you have had patients that have undergone orthognathic surgery, it's likely that he was involved to some extent. The world of oral surgery is often an unknown to the average GP, and we hope that Dr. Mehra can shine a light on what his specialty can offer our patients (aside from standard 3rd molar extractions and implants). </p>

      <h1>May 1st, 2026: Dr. Nate Lawson</h1> 
    <h4>
      Advanced Topics in Prevention in the morning, Updates on Restorative and 3d printed materials in the afternoon
    </h4>

      Some of you will remember Dr. Lawson from a few years ago.  He was the guy who made material science interesting.  He has been busy these last few years publishing on many new topics which he will share with us at his lecture next Spring. If you've seen him before, you know what you're in for.  If you haven't, you won't want to miss this one. Check him out on IG, @dentinaltube.
